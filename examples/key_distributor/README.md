# Key Distributor Cloud Function

This example illustrates how to use the `key-distributor` submodule to generate a secure service account key distribution Cloud Function.

## Exporting GPG Public Key

On top of the typical Terraform setup, we need to export the public key the Cloud Function will use. Make sure you have the key you need in your local
gpg key chain. If it's in a public key server you can download it with:

```
gpg --receive-keys <key-id>
```

Once it's there locally, you can export the ASCII armored version of it with this and store it into a file:

```
gpg --export --armor <key-id> > pubkey.asc
```

For usage instructions, see the [module README](../../modules/key-distributor/README.md)
